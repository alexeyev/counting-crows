## Counting Crows

In Russian, *to count crows* means *to laze around* 
or *to be unattantive*. This is a procrastination-driven 
project, hence the name.

A Raspberry Pi-based Telegram bot taking photos 
on request and asking how many crows one can see. 
The goal is to collect a small dataset for a simple 
computer vision task.

No relation to the band.
